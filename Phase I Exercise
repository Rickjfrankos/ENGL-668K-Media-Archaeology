There are six antique computers set up for you to experiment with at MITH. In this, Phase I of the Media Archaeology module, you will learn basic facts about the pedigree of each, figure out how to turn it on (not always obvious!), and perform a few simple tasks to get a feel for how it works. You will work individually for this first phase of the module, logging your activity with each machine via GitHub. (Feel free to ask a classmate for help if you’re genuinely stuck on something, but only after you’ve made an honest effort on your own.) 

For the second phase of the module (to be distributed) you will work in pairs or small groups, choosing one or two computers for a more detailed exploration which may involve building or making something with its original software, and/or doing deeper historical and analytical work. 

You will generally have access to the computers any time MITH is open to the public, which is Mon-Fri, 9-5. Feel free to contact me with any logistical or technical problems. Phase I of this module is due by October 27.

*** Safe Handling ***

Some of these computers are more than three and a half decades old! They built ‘em strong back then so you don’t have to handle them with kid gloves, but please do treat the hardware with respect. To that end:

•	Absolutely no food or drink on the tabletop.
•	Some of the plugs and connections holding everything together are loose or delicate. If a machine doesn’t turn on check that all of its components are snugly plugged and connected, and that there is power going to it. Use common sense to try troubleshooting.
•	Never force anything. If something doesn’t seem to want to work or go or bend or fit, leave it be and ask me.
•	Please keep fingers off of the recording surface of the diskettes. Also keep magnets away!
•	All of the computers except the two Macs can simply be switched off at any point (though you will lose your work unless it’s been saved to a disk). The Macs should always be shut down using the appropriate option under the “Special” heading of the home menu (top of screen).
•	When you turn a computer off, wait about 10 seconds before turning it back on.
•	Please neaten up the workspace around each computer when you finish. Return diskettes to sleeves and holders, stack any books in an orderly fashion, etc.
•	Above all: please remember to turn these computers OFF when you are done with them. Remember, the learning experience for everyone starts with figuring out how to turn them on! Moreover, they won’t go to “sleep” on their own, and whatever is left of their lifespan will be diminished if they are left running.

*** The Exercise ***

For each computer, answer the questions and perform the tasks indicated. Feel free to consult any reference sources you spot around MITH (check the spline!), and/or Wikipedia or other online sources.

Make some additional notes below about each machine as you go: What’s the most notable difference from a computer that you’re used to? Can this computer and its software do anything that your current computer cannot?

KAYPRO 4

•	What year was it made? 
  1984
•	What operating system does it run? 
  CP/M
•	How much did it cost (then and now, adjusted for inflation)? How hard is it to find one on the secondhand market (check eBay and Craig’s List). 
  Original MSRP of $1595 (inflation: ~$3350); Current value of $200-$300
•	In brief (a short paragraph), what were its historical strengths and weaknesses as a platform? What was it best known for?
  The Kaypro was a portable (luggable) computer that was used for word processing and printing. It used floppy dics,   which could save and copy data. It also supposedly had a better screen than most, which allowed for a "sharp display  ," which if true makes me wonder how bad prior displays were.

Turn it on (you must figure out how). Start WordStar (you must figure out how). Try typing a simple document, experimenting with some commands based on the keyboard template. (You don’t need to save your document.)
  I have to be honest, I was only able to turn it on, enter some commands from the online book and keyboard, but I      could not start wordstar. The books/tutorials I found online were not helpful enough.

APPLE IIe

•	What year was it made? 
  1977
•	What operating system does it run? 
  Apple DOS
•	How much did it cost (then and now, adjusted for inflation)? How hard is it to find one on the secondhand market (check eBay and Craig’s List). 
  Original MSRP: $1298-1638(inflation: ~$5500); Current cost of around $800-1300
•	In brief (a short paragraph), what were its historical strengths and weaknesses as a platform? What was it best known for?
  It had the first user-friendly OS. It was designed in a way that allowed the OS to crash less often and be more       reliable. It used floppy discs, which allowed for the data to be more transferrable between computers. It had a       bettter keyboard, which looks a lot more like the one we have today. Perhaps most important is that Apple was open    to 3rd party software and hardware, which made the computer itself more useful.

Turn it on (you must figure out how). Work your way through the Apple Presents Apple tutorial. Try a game or two. (If you can beat one of my high scores on Sea Dragon you’ll get a prize. Really!)
  I enjoyed naming myself "Poop" on the Apple tutorial and partaking in "Poop's Diner". I thought my ability to play    sea dragon would come naturally because I used one of these in elementary school--boy was I wrong.

MACINTOSH SE

•	What year was it made? 
  1987
•	What operating system does it run? 
  OSX6
•	How much did it cost (then and now, adjusted for inflation)? How hard is it to find one on the secondhand market (check eBay and Craig’s List). 
  Ogirinal MSRP $2900-3300 (~$5k with inflation); Now $200-300
•	In brief (a short paragraph), what were its historical strengths and weaknesses as a platform? What was it best known for?
  It was smaller than the Mac ii, and it was all 1 unit (the disk drive[s] were integrated into the computer). It was   the first Mac to feature an expansion slot for other hardware. It had an OS that was friendly for the use of a mouse. It was faster and more reliable than previous computers. The hardware was customizable and coule be made faster with   "accellerators". 

Turn it on (you must figure out how). Read some of Deena Larsen’s Marble Springs. Quit Marble Springs. What else is on this Mac?

-Marble Springs
-Story Space
-Moon to Deena, which seems to be some kind of interactive ebook
-We Descend
-Engl 668k folder (empty)
-Miss Sing

VECTREX

•	What year was it made? 
  1982-84
•	What operating system does it run? 
  It seems not to have a named OS.
•	How much did it cost (then and now, adjusted for inflation)? How hard is it to find one on the secondhand market (check eBay and Craig’s List). 
  Original MSRP $200 ($400 /w inflation) (this price then fell sharply); current value of $300-$500
•	In brief (a short paragraph), what were its historical strengths and weaknesses as a platform? What was it best known for?
  It was affordable and specialzed in video games. The Vectrex did not require a TV; it had its own screen. Its grid    screen was more like a real arcade game. The screen was customizable with screen filters. It had a unique controller   ; it's durable; and it has a large library of games.
Turn it on (you must figure out how). Play MineStorm. Try another cartridge. Why do you think the designer’s would have opted for the “vector” graphics?
  I think the vector graphics help you line up your shots and help you navigate better. Plus when you teleport it       helps you see where to look (it can only be one of two lines)

AMIGA

•	What year was it made? 
  1985-1996
•	What operating system does it run? 
  Amiga OS
•	How much did it cost (then and now, adjusted for inflation)? How hard is it to find one on the secondhand market (check eBay and Craig’s List). 
  Original MSRP $1600 (inflation: ~3000); Current value of around $700-1000.
•	In brief (a short paragraph), what were its historical strengths and weaknesses as a platform? What was it best known for?
  I can tell you first-hand that it had some awesome games, more intricate audio than the usual 8-bit sound, and        colorful graphics, which other computers didn't have. It allowed for peripheral devices, such as game controllers,    mouse, more disk drives, printers. It could copy disks. It had a faster processor than earlier computers (32 bit).    It used the smaller "floppy" disks that later 90s computers used. It had many features that allowed users to make     customizable sound and graphics, which helped accelerate the modern development of software. 
Turn it on (you must figure out how). Try the demos. What else can it do? (Hint: try the “Amiga Appetizer” disk). Have a look at the Amiga magazines and the book, The Future Was Here.
  One of my most distinct memories was throwing away my old Amiga computer (fully operational) when I was a teenager.   It was my first computer (a hand-me-down from my Uncle/Cousins), and I enjoyed the heck out of it when I was really   young (~5-6 years old). I also remember being surprised how many video game discs I had (several hundred) and how     neat they all looked in the trash can. I probably ended up trowing away well over $1000. I still have some of the     disks if you want them for some reason, not many games though.

MACINTOSH IIci

•	What year was it made? 
  1989
•	What operating system does it run? 
  OS7
•	How much did it cost (then and now, adjusted for inflation)? How hard is it to find one on the secondhand market (check eBay and Craig’s List). 
  Original cost $6269 (inflation: ~$11,500); Current value $300-500
•	In brief (a short paragraph), what were its historical strengths and weaknesses as a platform? What was it best known for?
  It was more compact, had an internal drive, a better processors than before (32 bit), and it had an external monitor   , which, with some modification, allowed the computer to spend less memory running the video graphics. It was very    popular in business settings because the word processing was very advanced and customizable. It also had a colorful   screen, though the one at MITH does not. Oh, and of course, it could connect to the internet and write emails. 
Turn it on (you must figure out how). Open WordPerfect. Open MS Word. Try typing a simple document in each. Which do you like better, and why? Open MacPaint. Try drawing something. (You don’t need to save any of your work from these applications.) What else is on this Mac? What can you learn about its past user(s)?
  This MS Word reminds me a lot of the MS Word that I used back in the 90s. I'm surprised it has so many features       after being underwhelmed with the word processing on the other computers. You can add charts, graphs, grids, lists,   images, page numbers, fonts. I see why businesses liked it so much. I almost didn't notice that this computer allows   me to double-click to quickly highlight a word or line of text, a feature that I take for granted now.
  
  Maybe its my unfamiliarity with Mac word processing, but Word Perfect seems much less impressive. It either has less   features or I simply do not know where they are/their location is not as obvious.
  
  It also has Excel. I see that the previous user had a list of who liked what toppings on their pizza lol. I also see   that this computer must have been used at UMUC. 
  
  It also has virus protection, which I guess is becoming a problem at this time due to the internet.
